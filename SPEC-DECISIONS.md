# Otter Spec Decisions

`rules.md` plus Jeff's build brief are the language design. This file resolves
the questions they leave open, so that two agents implementing different halves
of Otter make the *same* choice.

**If you disagree with anything here, change it here first, then tell both
agents.** Never resolve an ambiguity inside implementation code.

Authority order, highest first:

1. Jeff's build brief
2. `rules.md`
3. this file
4. the code

## Scope: what 0.2 covers

| In 0.2 (milestones 1-6) | Deferred |
|---|---|
| variables, `say`, math, `ask` | objects (`is a thing`) -> 0.3 |
| `if` / `otherwise` / nesting | custom types (`a Person has`) -> 0.3 |
| `and` / `or` / `not` | files, `run`, HTTP, JSON -> 0.4 |
| `while`, `repeat`, `count from`, `for each` | |
| lists incl. `empty` / `contains` | |
| functions, parameters, `return`, local scope | |

Deferred keywords are **reserved and lexed now**, so adding them later cannot
break existing programs.

---

## Project structure

The brief suggests `src/Contract/Token.ps1` and `Ast.ps1`. We use a single
`Otter.Contract.psm1` **at the repo root** instead. This is the PS 5.1
adjustment the brief allows, for two measured reasons:

- PowerShell 5.1 shares classes across files **only** via `using module`.
  Dot-sourcing a `.ps1` does not export classes. So contract files must be
  `.psm1`, not `.ps1`.
- `using module` needs a stable literal relative path. Every module in the
  project imports the contract, so its path is frozen along with its contents.

Verified on PS 5.1: `using module` resolves relative to the **script file**,
not the working directory, and classes keep their type identity across module
boundaries — an object built in the parser satisfies `-is [Node]` in the
interpreter.

## D1. `add` is both a builtin and a legal function name

```otter
add 5 to score              # builtin: mutate
to add number1 and number2  # a user function also named "add"
```

**Decision (brief section 9): built-in grammar always wins.** The parser tries
built-in statement forms before user-defined calls. `add <expr> to <name>` is
always the builtin. No namespaces, no disambiguation mechanism — do not invent
one now.

> Consequence: a user function named `add` taking a `to` argument is
> unreachable. Accept the definition, and consider renaming the example in
> `rules.md` to `to sum number1 and number2`.

---

## D2. `is` means assignment OR comparison depending on position

```otter
age is 29                # assignment
if age is at least 18    # comparison
```

- Statement level, `<identifier> is <expr>` -> **assignment**
- Inside a condition (after `if`, `while`, `otherwise if`) -> **comparison**

| Otter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `is` | equal to |
| `is not` | not equal to |
| `is at least` | >= |
| `is at most` | <= |
| `is greater than` | > |
| `is less than` | < |

---

## D3. `make` and `makes` are the same word

Both are accepted and produce the same AST. **`make` is canonical** — prefer it
in docs and examples. `makes` exists for compatibility with `rules.md`.

---

## D4. The period does three different jobs

1. A line whose trimmed text is exactly `.` -> `BlockEnd` token
2. `.` directly between identifier characters, no spaces -> member access
   (`person.name`) — lexed now, executed in 0.3
3. `.` between two digits -> part of a number (`3.14`)
4. `.` inside a string literal -> ordinary text (`"years old."`)

A `.` anywhere else is an error.

---

## D5. `count from 1 to 5 as number` is real

In 0.2. Both bounds **inclusive**. Bounds are full expressions, so
`count from start to finish as n` must work, not just literals.

---

## D6. `ask` coerces at input time

**REVISED — the earlier version of this decision was wrong.**
Per brief section 11, `ask` does **not** always return text. It performs safe
automatic primitive conversion as it reads:

| The user types | Otter stores |
|---|---|
| `29` | the number `29` |
| `3.5` | the number `3.5` |
| `true` / `false` | the boolean |
| anything else | the text, unchanged |

So `ask "How old are you?" and call it age` followed by
`if age is at least 18` works with no further coercion.

Comparison still coerces where sensible: a numeric string and a number compare
equal. Where a number is required and the value cannot be one, it is a runtime
error naming the value.

---

## D7. Indentation

**REVISED — the earlier version of this decision was wrong.**
Per brief section 15, tabs are **allowed**, not an error.

- **4 spaces = one level. 1 tab = one level.**
- A file may use either style.
- Indentation that does not resolve to a whole level is an error naming the
  line, in the brief's format:

  ```text
  Indentation error on line 7:
  expected indentation level 2 but found inconsistent whitespace.
  ```

- Jumping more than one level deeper at once is an error.
- **Blank lines and comment-only lines never affect blocks** — skip them
  entirely *before* measuring indentation.
- The lexer emits explicit `Indent` / `Dedent` tokens. The parser never
  re-measures whitespace.
- A `.` on its own line closes the innermost open block early.

---

## D8. How `say` joins its parts

```otter
say name "is" age "years old."   ->   Jeff is 29 years old.
```

- Join every part with exactly **one space**
- Numbers print without trailing zeros: `10`, not `10.00`; `3.5` stays `3.5`
- Booleans print as `true` / `false`
- Lists print as their items joined with `, `
- `say` with no parts prints a blank line
- There is **no interpolation syntax** — not `{name}`, `${name}`, or `$name`

---

## D9. Truthiness

| Value | Truthy? |
|---|---|
| `true` | yes |
| `false` | no |
| a number | yes unless `0` |
| text | yes unless empty |
| a list | yes unless empty |
| null | no |
| undefined variable | **runtime error**, not `false` |

---

## D10. Identifiers, keywords, comments

- **Keywords are lowercase only.** `If` is an identifier, not a keyword.
- **Identifiers are case-sensitive.** `loggedIn` and `loggedin` differ.
- Identifiers: letter or `_` first, then letters/digits/`_`.
- **Comments** start with `#` outside a string, and run to end of line.
  `name is "Jeff" # username` works; `say "#1"` keeps the `#`.
- Using an undefined variable is a runtime error naming the variable and line.

---

## D11. `and` is BOTH addition and boolean-and

New in the build brief (section 13), and the sharpest ambiguity in the
language:

```otter
number1 and number2 make total     # addition
if loggedIn and admin              # boolean and
```

**Decision: position decides, exactly like `is` in D2.**

- Inside a **condition** (after `if`, `while`, `otherwise if`, or `not`),
  `and` is **always boolean**.
- In a **statement** ending in `make`/`makes`, `and` is **addition**.

Precedence inside conditions, tightest first:

```text
not        (tightest)
and
or         (loosest)
```

So `if not a and b or c` parses as `if ((not a) and b) or c`.

> Known edge: `if total is 5 and 5` is ambiguous in principle. The rule above
> makes it boolean, which will read oddly. Nobody writes this. Do not add
> syntax to fix it.

---

## D12. `add` / `remove` dispatch on the target's runtime type

```otter
add 5 to score              # number  -> arithmetic
add "Pokemon" to games      # list    -> append
remove 2 from score         # number  -> arithmetic
remove "Mario" from games   # list    -> remove item
```

**Decision: one AST node per verb.** `AddToStmt` and `RemoveFromStmt` cover
both cases; the **interpreter** dispatches on what the target actually holds.
The parser never needs to know. If the target is neither a number nor a list,
it is a runtime error naming the variable and its actual type.

---

## D13. Lists

```otter
games are              games are empty
    "Zelda"
    "Mario"
.
```

- A list literal is closed by `.` or by dedent. The brief prefers the explicit
  `.` because the relationship to following indentation is otherwise
  ambiguous — **write it in examples**, but accept both.
- `games are empty` produces a `ListDefStmt` with zero items.
- `if games contains "Zelda"` -> `ContainsExpr`. Comparison uses the same
  equality rules as `is`.
- Lists are 0.2. Nesting lists inside lists is not.

---

## D14. Error message format

Per brief section 32, errors are written for beginners. Two forms:

- `Format()` — one line, used by the REPL:
  `Otter: I expected a number but got "banana" (line 4)`
- `FormatDetailed()` — the block form, used when running a script file:

  ```text
  Otter Syntax Error

  Line 4:
      if age is greater 18

  Otter expected "than" after "greater".

  Try:
      if age is greater than 18
  ```

Rules:

- Every error carries a **real line number**.
- Populate `SourceLine` whenever the source is available — the offending line
  is most of the value.
- Populate `Suggestion` whenever a plausible fix exists.
- **A raw PowerShell exception must never reach a normal user.** The entry
  point catches everything; only `-DebugAst`-style developer mode shows stack
  traces.
